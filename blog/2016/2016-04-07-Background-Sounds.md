#Background Sounds

A few sites to generate [background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_noise) sounds and help with productivity in noisy offices. Work best combined with noise canceling headphones. The ones that generate random like patterns works best against repeated sounds, but on my experience are not so good against not so random noise such as human conversations. Music, classical or (better) slow pop, works much better against human generated noises.

 Good sounds, not much selection, but can auto-select some interesting combined presets.

 Make your own ambient mix, in hope it is better than the current reality.

 It is all rain, but it has some variability to avoid depression.

 Slow country music radio with very few interruptions, useful as an change when the above become boring.
