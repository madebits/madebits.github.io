[![@left@](blog/images/pyconde.jpg)](http://pycon.de) I attended for three days, [PyCon.de](http://www.pymunich.com/) in Munich. With one day of sprints, two days of talks, along with workshops in parallel, PyCon.de is a relatively small conference one can attend over a weekend.

As someone of the conference put it during the coffee breaks: *Python is the second best language for everything, which makes it very powerful*. My focus was on scientific Python and machine learning talks, my new hobby. Of course one could read these on his own, or view the videos, but being there helps keep the focus and see what others are doing. People are faced up and solving same problems in every community and cross-community look up help gather ideas and find solutions.

The benefit of being alone in a conference cannot be overstated. One does not have his usual confidence group with and is open to small talk with other lonely souls there. This is even more important then the content of the conference itself. I was lucky to speak with some very interesting people. I meet also a former university colleague working at [Skoobe](https://www.skoobe.de/) and giving also a talk there. [Skoobe](https://www.skoobe.de/) looks very interesting and if you have conscience problems, you are not reading as much fiction as you would like to, you should definitively give Skoobe a try. I used also the chance of being in Munich to meet a friend living there.

I attended a workshop on *Python for Mathematics, Science and Engineering* and the trainer was a really nice guy. I had a chance to speak with him during the lunch. He keeps similar workshops in similar Python events. If you have the possibility to go there, I would recommend it. The notebooks are on [GitHub](https://github.com/caichinger/slides), but having the possibility to pair with similar interested people, helping each other adds extra value that you cannot get at home alone.

The conference was at LMU Institute of Computer Science, and the the food was fully ok and more that enough for everyone. With kind support from ProSieben, we had a really nice coffee team there. I could not drink enough of the cappuccino they instantly made, but still slept well, maybe I was too tired. Internet access at LMU was tricky to setup in Ubuntu, but I managed to get it work without running the script the offered, given I am not a fun of such ready made scripts.

Several companies were represented and JetBrains was giving free PyCharm licenses. I got a T-Shirt and a nice yo-yo from them, my son is going to like. In overall, the conference was a nice place, with people being kind to each other, sharing ideas and having fun with Python.
