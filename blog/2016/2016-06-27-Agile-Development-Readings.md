[Agile is Dead](https://youtu.be/a-BOSpxYJ9M) presentation explains agile software development as a self-regulating [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)-like way of producing software. The basic *repetitive* steps to Agility, borrowed from the video are: *Find where you are*, *Take a small step towards your goal*, *Adjust your understanding based on what learn*, combined together with the wisdom that when *faced with similar alternatives choose the path that makes future change easier*. Basic wisdom aside, agile software development has grown to have its own vocabulary and [common](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-and-Agile-Webcasts) [techniques](http://www.collab.net/services/training/agile_e-learning).

##Learning Agile (2014)

[![@left@](blog/images/book-la.png)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025849.do) *Learning Agile* summarizes and goes into details of common agile software methodologies and best practices, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming, Lean, and Kanban. Authors share their experiences, mainly on Scrum, and explain how they understand common practices. I found sometimes the authors' understandings are not completely shared by other practitioners in the field, but in overall, the book provides a good introduction from people that have spend some time in management of agile software development teams.

##Coaching Agile Teams (2010)

[![@left@](blog/images/book-ca.png)](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321637704) *Coaching Agile Teams* teaches that coaching starts and ends with you - the coach - that every one is looking for. In between, there is a whole of wisdom to master. This book has very influential to a whole generation of scrum masters and it has made the martial arts term [Shu-Ha-Ri](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html), known to all agile software development practitioners. I found reading the book informative and filled with common sense. I am not sure how much of it will remain with me for a long time, but it is the kind of spiritual book you always want to have a copy with you.

##Succeeding with Agile (2009)

[![@left@](blog/images/book-sa.png)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/succeeding-with-agile-software-development-using-scrum) *Succeeding with Agile* is a book I still have to finish reading. I find it very interesting as it combines the theory with enough practical tips to get you started in the right direction. The book is especially useful for usage in corporation environment and shows how agile techniques fit to common project management tasks. This book is more practical than *Coaching Agile Teams*, though both are timeless books worth reading.

##JIRA Agile Essentials (2015)

[![@left@](blog/images/book-ja.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/jira-agile-essentials) *JIRA Agile Essentials* is usually not a book to be listed on the same page as the other two above, but I found it to be an extended handbook on JIRA Agile. Having software manage Scrum or Kanban removes the wallboard creativity that makes every agile team unique. Nevertheless, in many companies standard software helping with management of agile software development is indispensable for internal practices. Being familiar with common mainstream agile development software helping tools is essential for every agile coach.
