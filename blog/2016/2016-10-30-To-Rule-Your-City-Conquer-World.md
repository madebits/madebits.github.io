#To Rule Your City Conquer World

The best strategy for common code modules to be re-used in your company, is the same as for something to be used globally world wide:

* Look for things screaming to be shared.
    > No one knows better than developers that write the code what is worth sharing. Most of things solve quickly and dirty a problem and this is their *raison d'Ãªtre*. Few things evolve to serve to a higher calling. You cannot always plan for this, but you hear some code screaming for more recognition. That code with few effort can be made generic and shared.
* Invest some time to clean things up.
    > Never release something uncleaned. Make sure the code is clean and it works. Do not spend much time, but a little investment in polishing something existing can made a difference. If you can add some documentation, make a video - it all helps. The more you document, the less people will ask, the more they will be willing to use what you provide. At this level, the company can help apply some micro-management.
* Open source under a suitable license.
    > Most companies use open source libraries and tools, even if it for internal use and never sell them. This adds quick value to the company based on work of others. It is ok to do this, but at some point, if you can, try to convince your company to contribute something back to the community. Most generic middle-ware can be given out for free and will not affect competition or IP rights. While open code also helps every company advertise itself, if your company does not want to get associated with something, it is still ok. Ask if you can release it open source under you name. No one will know and the company and the project may benefit from external free feedback. 
* Tell people about it.
    > Ask your company support you speak and be visible about the contributed work. Have some blog, where different team members can share ideas. Ask for some internal authority review the blog posts before you publish them even if purely technical. Explain what made you do it, what problem you had. People will consider the solution only after they identify themselves with the problem first. Reach out to as many people as you can.
* If you can, build a community.
    > Well, there is no point in feeling guilty if people complain. You complain about stuff from others too. Enable people to contribute, and plan for some time to look at that as long as it is on your benefit. If you abandon maintenance because your company project moves on, state it clear. Communities start on common needs, but survive on common ideals. Every piece of legacy software could live a second life in the community.
