#Remote Retrospectives

2016-10-28

<!--- tags: agile -->

In my current project, we have some members of the Sprint team working remote. This makes it challenging to organize successful *Retrospectives* without some preparation. Given we are [Google Apps](https://gsuite.google.com/index.html) users, I prepare the retrospective steps using Google Docs and all people use their own laptops to collaborate on the shared document in real-time as the retrospective goes on.

##Five Steps Retrospectives

On recommendation from our external agile coach, we follow a [five-step](http://www.slideshare.net/estherderby/agile-retrospectives-4976896) retrospective using [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) to guide us though the steps and give all team an equal chance to contribute. We have a backlog of themes and ideas for retrospectives used as a guide to choose a relevant theme. I play with [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) till I find five-steps that I fully understand and think we can follow. We share the theme and the actual [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) instance link in a Google Document with team before the meeting, so they have some time to look and prepare about the discussion.

##Shared Collaboration Board

Steps in [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) are more effective if associated with a local visual board. To remedy that, I create upfront a shared Google Document conforming as much as possible to the [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) steps. The document contains the theme, the main points, the five steps, and depending on the actual action cards - the needed empty tables to be filled by team members during the meeting.

```
Retrospective: Theme
- sub-theme1
- sub-theme2
...

1. Set the stage: 20 minutes
...
2. Gather data: 20 minutes 
...
3. Generate insights: 20 minutes
...
4. Decide what to do: 20 minutes
...
5. Close the retrospective: 10 minutes
...
```

I try to adapt information to be provided by the team on each step card as tables, even if they are originally forethought as 2D scatter plots, as this makes it more easy to work in parallel in a shared document.

During the actual meeting, the team members uses their laptops to contribute on each step via the shared document on real time, along with common audio conference and screen sharing of my view of the browser. Each stage is time limited. The entire team can contribute alone (or in groups) in parallel and collaborate on common ideas in a guided way.
