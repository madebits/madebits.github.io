#Remote Retrospectives

2016-10-28

<!--- tags: agile -->

In my current project, we have some members of the Sprint team working remote. This makes it challenging to organize successful *Retrospectives* without some preparation. Given we are Google Apps users, I prepare the retrospective steps using Google Docs and all people use their own laptops to collaborate on the shared document in real-time as the retrospective goes on.

On recommendation from our external agile coach, we follow a [five-step](http://www.slideshare.net/estherderby/agile-retrospectives-4976896) retrospective using [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) to guide us though the steps. I choose a relevant theme based on most important issues and recommendations from the team (we have a backlog of themes and ideas for retrospectives). Then, I use [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) till I find five-steps that I fully understand and think we can follow. I share the theme and the actual [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) instance link in a Google Document with team before the meeting, so they have some time to look and prepare about the discussion.

Steps in [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) are more effective if associated with a local visual board. To remedy that, I created upfront a shared Google Document with 2D structure with tables conforming as much as possible to the [plans-for-retrospectives](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com) steps. The document contain the theme, the main points, the 5 steps and depending on the actual action cards - the needed empty tables to be filled by team members during the meeting. I try to adapt things as tables, even if they are originally forethought as 2D scatter plots, as this makes it more easy to work in parallel.

During the actual meeting, the team members uses their laptops to contribute on each step via the shared document on real time, along with common audio conference and screen sharing of my view of the browser.
