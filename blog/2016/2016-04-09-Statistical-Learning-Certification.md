#Statistical Learning Certification

Last year, I took an advanced online [course](s/stat/Certificate3.pdf) for learning some [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Since then, I read tens of books about R including the famous [ISRL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book, but it was too late last year to register for the online course the book authors offer at Stanford OnLine. This year, I managed to take the related [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) course and today I got emailed my certificate of completion:

I feel much more confident about R now as I felt one year and a half ago - if one can ever claim that about R language. The programming part was relatively easy for me. Given, I had already read the book and knew the material (some parts by now deeper that the book), the most difficult part was to motivate myself to review the theoretical part. This was reflected in my lack of concentration on some exercises that resulted to a total of 76% success score. Nevertheless, I am happy with my result, as it was not the score I was interested in this time. I wanted to find a motivation to repeat some of the things I learned during last year, and this was the perfect occasion for that. I learned more than I expected and it helps a lot to see familiar topics explained again by experienced people.
