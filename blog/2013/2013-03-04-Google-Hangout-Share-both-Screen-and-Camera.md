#Google Hangout Share both Screen and Camera

2013-03-04

In a Google hangout one can either share the screen or the camera, but not both at same time. This makes it hard to concentrate in a conversation when you want also to show something on your screen. One way to be able to view both at the same time is to use [VideoLan Client (VLC)](http://www.videolan.org/).

In VLC first use [Media / Open Capture Device] to capture the camera. This must be done before the Google+ hangout is started. Then select [Video / Always On Top], and then [View / Minimal View]. Like this you have both the camera and the shared screen (use Fullscreen share in the Hangout).
