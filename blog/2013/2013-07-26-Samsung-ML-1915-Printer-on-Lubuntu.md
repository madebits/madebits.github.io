#Samsung ML-1915 Printer on Lubuntu

I tried installing the Samsung Unified Linux Driver directly, but it did not work. I uninstalled it and looked around. The following is a Lubuntu specific summary of steps I found at [Lynxworks](http://blog.lynxworks.eu/2010/11/samsung-ml-1915-with-ubuntu/) blog.

Add the repository to sudo leafpad /etc/apt/sources.list (this has to be edited manually):
```
deb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra
```
Add GPG key and update cache and install driver:
```
wget -O - http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/suldr.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samsungmfp-driver samsungmfp-data
```
Start CUPS: `sudo /etc/init.d/cups start`

You can check whether CUPS is running by visiting `http://localhost:631/` in your browser.

Turn on the printer connect it via USB.

Then use "System Tools / Printers" menu to install the printer. ML-1915 model will be then recognized during install.

To have CUPS start at boot, create a startup script for cups: `sudo leafpad /etc/network/if-up.d/cups` with this content:

```
#!/bin/sh
service cups restart
```

Then make the file executable: `sudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/cups`

Update: I found I could not print a PDF with image from Evince or any other program to the printer. After looking a bit around, I come with a workaround that I also posted as an answer in [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/270328/cannot-print-pdf-pages-with-images). I installed:

```
sudo apt-get install cups-pdf
```

Then I printed the PDF from Evince using the new PDF printer that is added by `cups-pdf` first. The output goes to `~/PDF` folder (can be configured in `/etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf`).
Then I opened the PDF file generated by `cups-pd` printer to Evince and printed it again to my real printer.

This worked. Using the 'Print to File' that comes by default by Lubuntu did not work, but the PDF printed added by `cups-pdf` properly converts the original PDF to a printable one.
