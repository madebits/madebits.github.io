#Lubuntu 13.10 Radeon Laptop Screen Black After Upgrade

After the upgrade from Lubuntu 13.04 to 13.10, my laptop monitor screen was remaining black just after plymouth. My external monitor was working ok.

Ubuntu uses by default the open source `radeon` driver, but I have changed it to the close source one. I tried `fglrx` that comes with Ubuntu, `fglrx_updates`, the latest AMD ATI beta driver (the non-beta seems not to work with kernel 3.11), all with same result. After looking around for two days, I even posted a question to [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/363255/lubuntu-13-10-amd-ati-radeon-laptop-screen-is-black-after-upgrade-from-13-04), to only find it was not only me that had same problem.

I figured out I had to remove closed source `fglrx` and install the open source Radeon driver. The open source driver fully supports my ATI card CEDAR Radeon HD 5430/5450/6330/6350/6370. I posted what I did in [askubuntu](Then I figured out I had to remove closed source fglrx and install the open source Radeon driver. The open source driver fully supports my ATI card CEDAR Radeon HD 5430/5450/6330/6350/6370. I posted what I did in askubuntu, this is an extended summary of that.), this is an extended summary of that.

Following the details [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection#Problem:_Need_to_purge_-fglrx), I fully removed the closed source fglrx driver and restarted the machine:

```
sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*
sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
sudo shutdown -r now
```

After restart both laptop screen and my external monitor screen worked. To set the resolution for the two monitors I used `arandr` tool. I [modified](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr) the `arandr` generated script to check and be applied only when my external monitor is connected.

To check I was using really the open source driver I tried first `sudo lshw -c video`. It shows `... configuration: driver=radeon ...`, and then that `dmesg | egrep 'drm|radeon'` shows some text.

Following the details on Ubuntu Radeon page and Bug864735, I activated also the HDMI sound, by editing as root `/etc/default/grub` and adding `radeon.audio=1` to kernel parameters:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash radeon.audio=1"
```

Then I ran `sudo update-grub`. After that, I remembered, I had done this exact step before, so I guess at some point of time in the past, I was using the too open source Radeon driver - so better I document this here that I find it again :). The open source driver fixes also the Chromium [Bug](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=123104) of tab titles not working with `fglrx`. `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` is not needed and can be removed.


Following instructions [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/63681/how-can-i-make-xrandr-customization-permanent), I copied the `arandr` modified script and have it called from two new files `/usr/share/mycustomdesktopvideo.sh` and `/usr/share/mycustomloginvideo.sh,` made them executable and called them from `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`:

```
[SeatDefaults]
greeter-session=unity-greeter
user-session=ubuntu
# for your login screen, e.g. LightDM (Ubuntu 11.10) or GDM (11.04 or earlier)
display-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomloginvideo.sh
# for your desktop session
session-setup-script=/usr/share/mycustomdesktopvideo.sh
```

`mycustomdesktopvideo.sh` script I used looks for my use case as follows (`xrandr --auto` should also do for the else part, but I have not tested it):
```
#!/bin/sh
externalMonitor=`xrandr | grep "HDMI-0 connected"`
if [ -n "$externalMonitor" ]; then
  xrandr --output VGA-0 --off --output LVDS --mode 1366x768 --pos 1920x312 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal
else
   xrandr --output VGA-0 --off --output LVDS --mode 1366x768 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --off
fi
```

This seem to work better than `/home/d7/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart` as pcmanfm scales the wallpaper better. One thing I noticed with the new lightdm is that before the login screen appears, I see for some fraction of a second my desktop session wallpaper. I guess this is some security related bug in lightdm.

##Update

To be able to run the monitor configuration script [automatically](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4489/a-tool-for-automatically-applying-randr-configuration-when-external-display-is-pl/13917) when the external monitor is connected or disconnected I modified first my monitors script as follows:

```
#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY=:0
logger "Custom Monitor Setup Start"
externalMonitor=`xrandr | grep "HDMI-0 connected"`
if [ -n "$externalMonitor" ]; then
  xrandr --output VGA-0 --off --output LVDS --mode 1366x768 --pos 1920x312 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal
else
   xrandr --output VGA-0 --off --output LVDS --mode 1366x768 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output HDMI-0 --off
fi
logger "Custom Monitor Setup End"
```

This basically exports first `DISPLAY`. I saw that [Chromium OS](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/platform/monitor_reconfig.git;a=blame;f=display-configure.sh;hb=ed4948c781bed219b3eae02fd4c93eb8d8638d88) does it like that. Chromium OS additionally exports `XAUTHORITY`. It [seems](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-basics/#h9) both `DISPLAY` and `XAUTHORITY` (X cookie can be extracted with `xauth`) variables must be exported to run X programs. If `XAUTHORITY` is not set X will rely on `xhost` settings for the local machine. I added also two calls to `logger` so that I can use `tail -n 10 -f /var/log/syslog` to monitor whether the script is called.

Then I looked with `udevadm monitor --property` to see what events do come from udev when I plug-in the external monitor and I got:

```
UDEV  [3917.610565] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
ACTION=change
DEVNAME=/dev/dri/card0
DEVPATH=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/drm/card0
DEVTYPE=drm_minor
HOTPLUG=1
ID_FOR_SEAT=drm-pci-0000_01_00_0
ID_PATH=pci-0000:01:00.0
ID_PATH_TAG=pci-0000_01_00_0
MAJOR=226
MINOR=0
SEQNUM=2616
SUBSYSTEM=drm
TAGS=:seat:uaccess:
USEC_INITIALIZED=9253
```

[Chrome OS](https://codereview.chromium.org/6825017/patch/1/2) relies on same event. So then I added a custom `udev` rule as `/etc/udev/rules.d/98-monitor.rule` with this content:

```
SUBSYSTEM!="drm", GOTO="label_end"
ACTION!="change", GOTO="label_end"

ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="drm", RUN+="/usr/share/mycustomdesktopvideo.sh"

#LABEL="label_end"
```

This seems to be only called sometimes, because most of the time `udev` does not generate the above event. An error is logged before `*ERROR* EDID checksum is invalid and then kernel: [ 4164.247333] [drm:radeon_dvi_detect] *ERROR* HDMI-A-1: probed a monitor but invalid EDID` and then `udev` does not propagate any event. So while this should theoretically work, in my case, it is not working reliably, so I have still to run the script manually if I change the monitors while the system is running.
