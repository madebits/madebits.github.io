# Lubuntu 18.04 Disable Initfsram Resume

2018-04-26

Upon update to latest Lubuntu 18.04, I got this message during boot, and the boot was delayed as result:

```
Gave up waiting for suspend/resume device
```

After a bit of search, I found out it related to resume from hibernation from initfsram. It seems on hibernation RAM data are stored in swap partition, and then on boot initfsram will look at partition to restore the system state.

So far so good, but, my system has no swap, neither a file, not a partition. I checked and I had a file `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` with this content:

```
RESUME=UUID=2ec9abc8-6c84-4681-9e62-c7fc748f202d
```

Deleting this file and running `sudo update-initramfs -u` did not work. I found the possible answer in a [bug](http://linux.debian.kernel.narkive.com/LUCVVdER/bug-860543-initramfs-tools-boot-delayed-by-30sec-waiting-for-suspend-resume-device) report. Either add to kernel boot parameter `noresume`, or what I tried and worked, was to edit `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` to be:

```
RESUME=none
```

And then run `sudo update-initramfs -u`. It best to ensure there is no hibernation active, if you have no swap partition and disable resume, otherwise current system RAM state maybe lost if the system enters hibernation.
