# Lubuntu 18.04 Disable Initfsram Resume

2018-04-26

<!--- tags: linux -->

Upon update to latest Lubuntu 18.04, I got this message during boot, and the boot was delayed as result:

```
Gave up waiting for suspend/resume device
```

After a bit of search, I found out it is related to the system resume from hibernation done via `initfsram`. It seems, on hibernation RAM data are stored in swap partition, and then at boot `initfsram` will look at resume swap partition to restore the system state.

My system has no swap, neither as a file, nor as a partition. I found a file `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` with this content:

```
RESUME=UUID=2ec9abc8-6c84-4681-9e62-c7fc748f202d
```

Deleting this file and running `sudo update-initramfs -u` did not work. 

I found the answer in a [bug](http://linux.debian.kernel.narkive.com/LUCVVdER/bug-860543-initramfs-tools-boot-delayed-by-30sec-waiting-for-suspend-resume-device) report. Either append `noresume` to kernel boot parameters, or edit `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` to be:

```
RESUME=none
```

And then run `sudo update-initramfs -u`. I tried this and it works.

It best to ensure there is no hibernation active, if you have no swap partition and when you disable resume like the above. Otherwise, current system RAM state could get lost if system enters hibernation (if using `zram` or something similar).
