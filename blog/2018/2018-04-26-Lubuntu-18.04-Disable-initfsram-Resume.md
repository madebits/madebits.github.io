# Lubuntu 18.04 Disable Initfsram Resume

2018-04-26

<!--- tags: linux -->

Upon update to latest Lubuntu 18.04, I got this message during boot, and the boot was delayed as result:

```
Gave up waiting for suspend/resume device
```

After a bit of search, I found out it is related to the system resume from hibernation done via `initfsram`. It seems, on hibernation RAM data are stored in swap partition, and then at boot `initfsram` will look at resume swap partition to restore the system state.

My system has no swap, neither as a file, not as a partition. I had a file `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` with this content:

```
RESUME=UUID=2ec9abc8-6c84-4681-9e62-c7fc748f202d
```

Deleting this file and running `sudo update-initramfs -u` did not work. 

Finally, I found the answer in a [bug](http://linux.debian.kernel.narkive.com/LUCVVdER/bug-860543-initramfs-tools-boot-delayed-by-30sec-waiting-for-suspend-resume-device) report. Either add to kernel boot parameter `noresume`, or the other alternative that I tried and worked, was to edit `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` to be:

```
RESUME=none
```

And then run `sudo update-initramfs -u`. 

It best to ensure there is no hibernation active, if you have no swap partition and disable resume like the above. Otherwise, current system RAM state could get lost when system enters hibernation.
