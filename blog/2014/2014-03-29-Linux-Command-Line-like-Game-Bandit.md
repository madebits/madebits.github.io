I ran into an addictive Linux command-line game called [Bandit](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.shtml) ([updated link](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)). The game is simple, but very addictive so that no matter what, once you start, you want to finish it. Proof that I went to the end of it: the `md5sum` of the string `madebits.com` concatenated with the 24th level password is `0af9d617ca85eab0c79b02c31f6b8cae`. Currently 24 is the last game level.
