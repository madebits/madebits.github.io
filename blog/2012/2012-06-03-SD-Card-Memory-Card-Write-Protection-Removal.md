#SD Card Memory Card Write Protection Removal

2012-06-03

I bought recently a SD-Card (Sandisk) for my Asus EeePC X101, which my other main Asus laptop was reporting as read-only.

The micro-SD-Card came up with an adapter, but I would not get my Asus laptop write to it using the adapter. No matter what I did it was complaining the SD-Card was write-protected.

Then I noticed something strange. I put the card in locked position put in the laptop, removed it and it was in the unlocked position. When the card was inserted, the lock/unlock switch was moved to the bottom lock position. When the card was removed, the lock/unlock switch was moved on its own back to the top unlock position.

Once this was clear, I put a plastic tape around the switch to stop it from moving. Use this method on your risk as the tape can be removed and remain inside the card-reader.
