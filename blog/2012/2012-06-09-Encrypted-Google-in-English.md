#Encrypted Google in English

Until today, https://encrypted.google.com was always in English even in non-English speaking countries, such as Germany, which I found nice. Today, I found it redirects me to the German version. I run in private mode, without any Google login, so it is not a matter of cookies, or settings.

To make it start with and search the international English version, I used now https://encrypted.google.com/?hl=en and updated my browser home button shortcut to it.

Alternatively, https://encrypted.google.com/?gl=us (or both https://encrypted.google.com/?hl=en&gl=us) can be used to get USA results.

For bing.com the same can be done via http://www.bing.com?cc=us.
