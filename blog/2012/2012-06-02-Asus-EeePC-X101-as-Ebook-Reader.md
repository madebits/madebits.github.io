#Asus EeePC X101 as Ebook Reader

I was looking around for a small non-expensive eBook reader for a while. Finally, I decided to buy an Asus EeePC X101 net-book instead. Asus X101 makes a better eBook reader for my needs. It has higher resolution (1024 x 600) and bigger screen size that most eBook reader devices and can render normal PDFs much better. Most of the books I read are technical books. I do not want to covert their PDFs to something else that would loose most of the formatting.

With every ebook device you buy membership to some on-line store. This is something I would pay for, but almost never use. Asus X101 comes also with some OEM on-line access, but I can remove it and install something else.

Asus X101 is a generic purpose netbook. It is useful in far more ways than a limited ebook reader. I read mostly at home in the couch, so the battery life of 3 hours is not a problem for me and screen emits more light resulting in a better indoor and outdoor view.

X101 is in the entry level price segment, being on same price range as ebook readers. This is significantly cheaper than a tablet PC. I was surprised the (supposedly weak) Intel Atom N435 dual-core processor and 1GB or RAM are fully capable of almost all my needs for PDF, Internet, and video.

A benefit of X101 being less capable than other models is its small weight and very thin size. It comes with 8GB SSD which is not much, but still enough to install a working copy of Linux with the software I need. To store data I bought an extra micro SD-Card of 16GB.
