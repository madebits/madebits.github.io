#How To Speak Like A Leader

There was an interesting [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19349676) on Hacker News today on how to speak like a leader and I decided to collect here a summary of main points for future reference.

1. Speak about *options* not *demands*. Think about *pros* and *cons* of every option.
    * Saying something is an option leaves door open for insecurity, whereas saying we *have to* do something and being wrong makes you look incompetent to represent a team.
    * Present solution options, articulate the benefits and the costs, offer your opinion and have a discussion.
1. Offer *options* and leave management / client take the decisions.
    * Never say you can't do something. Provide options, costs and consequences.
1. Avoid picking favorite solutions and presenting them as the winner or as the only option.
    * It is easy to trick management with favorable options (especially  on technical topics), but that should not be the goal.
    * Prefer working for a boss that can explain why your idea is stupid.
    * Have people accept your idea as theirs, by arguing against it with surface arguments, if it benefits the team. Do what has to be done.
1. Figure out the business truth and base decisions upon that, rather than focus on non-business topics.
1. Summarize your choices in a high level language, never get more technical than is required.
    * Figure out what others care about and speak to that.
    * Associate with non-engineers to learn their language.
1. Don't use your team to work on a project/product. User the project to work on your team.
    * Engineers assume people are tools/resources to build the product.
    * Leaders use the development of product to grow the team with empathy. People are not there to build the product, they are there to gain personal fulfillment.
    * Empower your reports to do their best work, using empathy and engineering the team to keep them productive.
    * Build a culture that helps everyone perform better.
    * As a [leader](https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Ultimate-Business-How-Book-ebook/dp/B000FCK3GO) you need to motivate, inspire, and instill confidence, almost every [day](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building-ebook/dp/B00DQ845EA).
1. Speak like to leader to management and team, but sometimes speak like an engineer to engineers. That is an advantage of a manager with engineering background.
1. An engineer focuses on the what, where, and how. A leader focus on who and why (related [Ted](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) talk) and is in charge of big picture.
    * There are three levels of thinking: a) strategically (long term, executive team), b) tactically (who and why, engineering management), c) operationally (what and how, engineers, but it help to know the why).
1. How you can influence those above you can impact your team effectiveness, even if your team is not aware of that.
    * Try teaching something new (successes/failures) to your managers when you speak to them. Speak about side projects, news, videos, experiences that can have some future impact on product.
1. Think about your Audience. Your team's job is execution, executives job is prioritization. 
    * Give your manager only the information he wants / needs.
    * Communicate: status of project, external blockers, progress (as metrics), important personnel issues.
    * People will ask for more information if they want it.
1. Figure out the tip of problem and leave team get involved early on to handle the problem and solutions. Help non-performers on the private. Talk less, let others be doers, make others the hero of their [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBa9EoEbb38).
    * Aks for clarification.
