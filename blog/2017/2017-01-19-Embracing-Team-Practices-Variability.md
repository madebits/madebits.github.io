#Embracing Team Practices Variability

One aspect of moving towards a more agile software development process is to develop software by following best practices, external and internal - what other teams with the company do.

##Best Practices As Initial Guidelines

Best software development practices change with time, technology used, people involved, actual system built, and domain being modeled. They do not apply same on every particular situation. Hence, variability in following best contemporary practices is unavoidable and should be embraced.

Achieving consistency in applying best software development practices same across all projects is usually disadvantageous. Global consistency brings with a bigger momentum that makes it much harder for whole teams of people to experiment with new ideas and practices.

##Team Specific Practices

It is preferable to have an agreement per team and per project on best followed software development practices, combined with a uniform global process around software development. Team and project specific practices for best software development practices create a natural isolated boundary for variability and improvement. All teams and individuals improve and learn in this natural ongoing process.

##Improving with Experience Exchange 

Experience exchange within and across teams, using planned presentation or internal and public, is the key to improvement and convergence in best practice across all teams. Convergence of best software development practices is a limit to strive for, but never reach.  Allow room for experimentation within each team and project and move each time a bit forward.
