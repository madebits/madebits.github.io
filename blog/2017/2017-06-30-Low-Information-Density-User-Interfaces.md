#Low Information Density User Interfaces

<!--- tags: design -->

There is a trend in contemporary web and application design to use a lot of space and fewer content per visible portion of the page - having as result lower information density. Being able to grasp same information as we used to access before requires spending more energy via scrolling and clicking.

Users prefer low information density interfaces as they often only show one thing at a time and remove initial usage stress. For same reason mobile users prefer apps to (mobile) web sites. Low information density UI is the key to attract a massive user base and have people like your web site or application from the very start.

Users pay somehow for the initial cognitive relief in long-term as they have to spend more total effort to access information. There is no warranty long-term users will ever tranced and be aware of wishing to switch to higher information density interface. People get used to the habit energy of scrolling and clicking and may not be aware of the extended long-term effort. 

Low information density UIs become debatable for power users if it is the only interface to a web site or application. Power users due to previous exposure to similar applications want more information at once from the very start to be able to quickly make used of that. If power users make a significant part of your business, it could be worth to address their needs and invest in user selectable information density in the interface. In all other cases, users will be better served by low information density interfaces.
