#Learning in Scrum

Continuous learning play a crucial role in Scrum. In this post I want to focus on Scrum team learning process to keep up with technology advances. In the technology space, every aspiring individual has to devote some time to learning new tools, technology, changing best practices. This includes the whole Scrum team developers, scrum masters, and product owners. 

##Improve and Conquer New Worlds

Scrum framework focuses explicitly on work done. It may look tempting to constrain domain specific learning only in the context of work "Done". Indeed in a project, most of the work is related to producing something and most of the knowledge collected and learned applies to the current technology used in the project. However, allowing some entropy in the learning process and encouraging exploring more than what is used in the daily work, is beneficial to the individuals, to the team, and to the company as a whole.

Learning is part of *Kaizen* and a good Scrum team should explicitly encourage learning. In a fast moving technology world, people feel a constant impostor syndrome and invest a lot of time to catch up and remain relevant. This process goes on during working hours and in their free time. Leaving this process take its flow is part of a successful scrum team, which is not thrown out when the project finishes. Having team members with constant top knowledge on various domains is also what a good company wants.

##Continuous Learning is Part of Work Done

In the classical waterfall approach, technology and architecture are decided mostly upfront, often not by the people that will work in the project, resulting in failure, or very poor quality software. In such a environment, it is common to have a specialized team of people that scan and evaluate technology and then push it to specific projects, possibly offering training before the project starts. Evaluating technology by specialized teams is a poor choice because people on such teams usually only look how the new technology is applied to simple cases - on 'Hello world' like problems. Their experience is often different from that of people that will actually work in the project, resulting in even more problems with successful selected technology adoption. No one, despite the experience, can foresee upfront how good a given set of technologies will actually work for a given project.

In the Scrum world, architecture evolves with the project and is part of ongoing work. Uncertainty and experimentation are dealt with architectural spikes as part of Sprint backlog items. Architectural spikes are a form of learning, but they do not replace the ongoing effort of the team to learn and keep up with new upcoming technology. A good Scrum team recognizes this need and encourages constant learning, including topics that may not seem of interest to the project at hand. Without hindering the work "Done", a good Scrum team thinks about fitting a learning process as part of their slack time. Part of learning is always individual. Everyone reads different blogs and news sites and has different interests. As people speak and share reflections together, the self-organizing nature of empowered Scrum teams shows up and good Scrum master helps encourage this. People devote some time to look and discuss training videos together, experiment with small project, share their own experiences with team members, and so on.

##Transparent Learning

Learning activities will happen at some scale unorganized, no matter what the culture of the company is. In more restrictives companies, people will tend to do the activities on the hidden and share less of the learning process with each-other, while the company will seek to monitor the Internet in trying to understand what people do. In a good Scrum team, members and management understands these activities happen and empowers people to spend balanced time on them. Learning has then the potential to move from a hideous, to an open and transparent activity. People will share more of the their learning process with each other and in total, all will benefit more, while spending less total time in the process.
