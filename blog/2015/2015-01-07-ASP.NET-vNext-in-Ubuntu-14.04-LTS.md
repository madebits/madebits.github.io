#Running ASP vNext in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

2015-01-07

<!--- tags: asp -->

To get [ASP.NET vNext](http://www.asp.net/vnext) (beta as this time) run in (L)Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you need first a recent version on [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives). At this time, Ubuntu ships Mono 3.2 is repositories and you need 3.4 or newer. To install current 3.10 version of Mono, I followed [instructions](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives) on the Mono web site.

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
sudo echo "deb http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian wheezy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-xamarin.list
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
```

I have modified the Mono web site example above to fix the keyserver URL. This is needed if you have some kind of firewall in place. Both the port and the schema are needed. You can then install `mono-complete` or only `mono-runtime`.

ASP.NET vNext [page](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) gives details on how to install *K Version Manager* (KVM) by using:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/Home/master/kvminstall.sh | sh && source ~/.kre/kvm/kvm.sh
```

To use `kvm` tool from command line you need to `source ~/.kre/kvm/kvm.sh`. You may want to add this line to your `~/.profile` file. `kvm list` should not list any *k runtime* (KRE) at this point. To install the latest KRE use `kvm upgrade`. The global NuGet config for the KRE is [found](http://gunnarpeipman.com/2014/10/running-asp-net-5-on-linux/) in `~/.config/NuGet/NuGet.Config`. ASP.NET vNext will work with empty configuration ok as of now.

Next, get the ASP.NET vNext sample applications via:

```
git clone https://github.com/aspnet/Home.git
```

Move to `Home/samples/HelloMvc` sample folder. There are three steps involved to run a sample:

1. Restore NuGet packages using: `kpm restore`. This command may fail if the SSL certificates of NuGet site are not trusted on your machine. To add them [use](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/197) (note the last command is without `sudo`):

	```bash
	#sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://go.microsoft.com
	#sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://nugetgallery.blob.core.windows.net
	sudo certmgr -ssl -m https://nuget.org
	#mozroots --import --sync
	```

	Try first only with nuget.org, if that does not [work](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/faq/security/), then uncomment the rest of commands and retry. sudo is not really needed, unless you want machine wide install.

2. Run: `kpm build` to build the sample `HelloMvc` project.

3. Start the web server with: `k kestrel` (kestrel command is defined in `project.js` file). If you get an error then you need to [build](http://olivierlefebvre.tumblr.com/post/101523386694/asp-vnext-alpa4-on-ubuntu) libuv manually:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/libuv/libuv.git
	cd libuv
	sh autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	```

	This installs libuv in `/usr/local/lib/libuv.so`, but kre has its own copy in `~/.kpm/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel/1.0.0-beta1/native/darwin/universal\libuv.dylib`. The location may change per version. Rename `libuv.dylib` to backup it and link:

	```
	ln /usr/local/lib/libuv.so -sf ~/.kpm/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel/1.0.0-beta1/native/darwin/universal/libuv.dylib
	```

	Run `sudo ldconfig` and re-try `k kestrel` command. You should see `Started` in console if all ok, and the web site is at http://localhost:5004/ (this location is set in `project.json` file).

Normally, pressing Ctrl+C should stop the kestrel server. The process [tree](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/KRuntime-structure) is `bash / k / klr / mono`, so killing `mono` will also stop the server.

```
├─xterm -e bash -ic k kestrel
│   │   │   │   │   │   └─k /home/user/.kre/packages/KRE-Mono.1.0.0-beta1/bin/k kestrel
│   │   │   │   │   │      └─klr /home/user/.kre/packages/KRE-Mono.1.0.0-beta1/bin/klr Microsoft.Framework.ApplicationHost kestrel
│   │   │   │   │   │          └─mono /home/user/.kre/packages/KRE-Mono.1.0.0-beta1/bin/klr.mono.managed.dll Microsoft.Framework.ApplicationHost kestrel
```

[OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) offers tools to edit C# projects in Ubuntu via common text editors, such as SublimeText. I found the *ASP.NET* Build System, that the *Kulture* package adds, was not working for [me](https://github.com/aspnet/kvm/issues/114). To fix that, I edited `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Kulture/ASP.NET.sublime-build` and changed the command to use `bash` instead of `sh` for `build.sh` line.

Some common folders:

* `~/.kre` - the kvm script and the installed k runtimes (kre) are put here
* `~/.kpm` - contains user wide packages needed to support k runtime applications and ASP.NET vNext
* `~/.config/NuGet` - NuGet configuration

There is a [yeoman](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/12/17/yeoman-generators-for-asp-net-vnext.aspx) based generator for ASP.NET. You can to install it globally (warning, it brings a lot of dependencies):

```
sudo npm install -g yo generator-aspnet
```

To generate a new project in current folder use: `yo aspnet` and give the project a name. The ASP MVC projects it generates have an dependency to `Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS` which you have to remove or comment out. As the projects `yo` generates are same as those in the ASP.NET samples, and it brings a lot of global NodeJs dependencies, you are better off by not using `yo` at all. Just clone one of the ASP.NET samples to get started.
