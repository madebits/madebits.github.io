#Agile in Regulated Environments

Developing medical device software in regulated environment requires following regulatory standards, such those set up by [FDA](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1), which if taken literally may seem to sometimes to contradict basic [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> practices. Software development process can either be agile or not. Middle ground, such as adopting agile terminology for non-agile processes, is often a sign that the process is not agile. Regulatory standards are not intended to hinder progress of software development processes, but rather to help guide software development assure required quality and auditability. Regulatory authors often cite (in the best common interest) the best software practices at the time the documents are written, with some going in more details than the others. Software development practices evolve faster than the regulatory documents (and what their authors see as valuable). The safest (and the most hindering) ground is to interpret regulatory literally and ignore contemporary software development practices.

##Descriptive vs Prescriptive Regulatory

Regulatory standards [provide](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) both **descriptive** (what to achieve) and **prescriptive** (how to achieve) guidelines. Agile community maintains that FDA and [IEC](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6792) like regulatory does not [prescribe](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2015/march/agile-adoption-in-regulated-environments) any particular development cycle. FDA [CRC 21](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1) main focus is to make sure enough documentation is produced so that a compliance body can ensure regulated software be traced, and that it is verified and validated. CRC 21 speaks of input and output documents which can have been interpreted as phase boundaries of a waterfall model, but they do not have to. CRC 21 can be considered a **descriptive** document. Evidence of traceability documents have to be present to achieve compliance, but they do not need to be created in phases. Scrum does not define what "Done" means. It only requires that the definition of "Done" is agreed upfront. Adding traceability and verification compliance to the definition of "Done" is the main way to ensure FDA good manufacturing practice compliance. 

[IEC](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6792) goes more on *prescriptive* side, so the detailed [project phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) have to be addressed. Prescriptive guidelines are a weakness of the compliance guidelines not of the agile. Prescriptive guidelines tries to encompass current good practices and in doing so they hinder future experimentation and evolution of best practices. For most organizations, the easiest way to get compliant products is to always follow prescriptive regulatory, which then contradicts any use of the newer agile frameworks.

##Modified Scrum is Not Scrum

A common safe ground would be to adapt agile frameworks and take over the *prescriptive* documents terminology. For example, [Disciplined Agile Delivery](https://disciplinedagiledelivery.wordpress.com/lifecycle/) (DAD) extends common agile frameworks end-to-end life-cycle decision framework. Unlike traditional Scrum, DAD recognizes different product lifetime phases and provides guidelines on how to deal with them. DAD phases can be modified to map to the IEC medical software development ones. [Coller & Manzarano](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) develop a DAD-like model for using Scrum-like methods in a medical compliant way, maintaining IEC phase terminology.  While DAD-like frameworks contain Scrum practices they are not Scrum. DAD recognizes this and uses non-scrum vocabulary. [Coller & Manzarano](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) adaptation uses Scrum terminology. A Scrum practitioner will [recognize](http://www.scrumguides.org/) terminology such as *Sprint 0*, or *hardening sprint* that do not match directly the Scrum values. They are justified as a compromise to balance any regulated process and agile conflicting forces.

##The Agile Way

Pure agile frameworks, such as Scrum, recognize that there are a lot of activities that happen outside Scrum and they do not address them on purpose to remain generic and widely applicable. The key to balance conflicting forces and to remain agile to external Scrum activities is to apply agile [values](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and the corresponding [principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) to them. Most organizations have to deal with prescriptive regulatory and try to minimize the compliance related risk. For example, preliminary software requirements specification (SRS) based on user stories does not conflict Scrum ideas. The whole development team is involved in defining the SRS with enough details to get started. The SRS is kept open to change as development progresses. In the same way, traceability and validation should be part of the "Done" definition. The development team recognizes that specific regulatory documentation is part of the medical product. Regulatory guidelines on documentation should be part of common *conditions of satisfaction*. Interpretation of the regulatory should be open to discussion and while there could be people that specialize on helping with that, development team feedback on case by case basis should be used to review the actual regulatory interpretation within the organization in context of the specific project.

##Going Agile for better Transparency

Agile is not about hindering transparency. Transparency is one of core empirical values that [guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/) Scrum. Transparency to interested external stakeholders, such as compliance bodies, guides the daily Scrum work and should be part of the "Done" definition. In an ideal world, regulatory bureaucracy would be treated as another stakeholder. The product owner, with support for specialized structure within the organization, should try to engage regulatory bureaucracy as early as possible in the product development when possible. Any traceability, verification, and validation requirements should be followed during the daily work. Having a cross-functional Scrum team in a regulated environment, means the validation and the regulatory people are part of the development team and contribute daily to achieve the definition of "Done".
