#Agile in Regulated Environments

Developing medical device software in regulated environment requires following regulatory standards, such those set up by [FDA](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1), which may seem to contradict basic agile and Scrum principles.

Regulatory standards [provide](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) both **descriptive** (what to achieve) and **prescriptive** (how to achieve) guidelines. Agile community maintains that FDA and [IEC](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6792) like regulatory does not [prescribe](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2015/march/agile-adoption-in-regulated-environments) any particular development cycle. FDA [CRC 21](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=820&showFR=1) main focus is to make sure enough documentation is produced so that a compliance body can ensure regulated software be traced, and that it is verified and validated. CRC 21 speaks of input and output documents which can have been interpreted as phase boundaries of a waterfall model, but they do not have to. CRC 21 can be considered a **descriptive** document. Evidence of traceability documents have to be present to achieve compliance, but they do not need to be created in phases. Scrum does not define what "Done" means. It only requires that the definition of "Done" is agreed upfront. Adding traceability and verification compliance to the definition of "Done" is the main way to ensure FDA good manufacturing practice compliance. 

[IEC](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6792) goes more on *prescriptive* side, so the detailed phases have to be addressed. Prescriptive guidelines are a weakness of the compliance guidelines not of the agile. Prescriptive guidelines tries to encompass current good practices and in doing so they hinder future experimentation and evolution of best practices. For most organizations, the easiest way to get compliant products is to always follow prescriptive regulatory, which then contradicts any use of the newer agile frameworks. A common safe ground would be to adapt agile frameworks and take over the *prescriptive* documents terminology.

[Disciplined Agile Delivery](https://disciplinedagiledelivery.wordpress.com/lifecycle/) (DAD) extends common agile frameworks end-to-end life-cycle decision framework. Unlike traditional Scrum, DAD recognizes different product lifetime phases and provides guidelines on how to deal with them. DAD phases can be modified to map to the IEC medical software development ones. [Coller & Manzarano](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) develop a DAD-like model for using Scrum-like methods in a medical compliant way, maintaining IEC phase terminology.  While DAD-like frameworks contain Scrum practices they are not Scrum. DAD recognizes this and uses non-scrum vocabulary. [Coller & Manzarano](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/compliant-agile-medical-device/) adaptation uses Scrum terminology. A seasoned Scrum practitioner will recognize terminology such as *Sprint 0*, or *hardening sprint* that do not match directly the Scrum values. They are justified as a compromise to balance any regulated process and agile conflicting forces.

Pure agile frameworks, such as Scrum, recognize that there are a lot of activities that happen outside Scrum and they do not address them on purpose to remain generic and widely applicable. The key to balance conflicting forces and to remain agile to external Scrum activities is to apply agile [values](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and the corresponding [principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) to them. While it is a bit unfortunate that most organizations have to deal with prescriptive regulatory trying to minimize the compliance related risk by failing to improve their development processes, there is no conflict as long as agile values and principles guide the process. A preliminary SRS, based on user stories does not conflict Scrum ideas, if the whole development team is involved in defining it and the SRS is kept open to change, having enough details to get started. In the same way, traceability and validation should be part of the "Done" definition. The development team should recognize that the specific documentation is not per se, but it is part of the medical product. Regulatory guidelines on documentation should be part of common *conditions of satisfaction*. Interpretation of the regulatory should be open to discussion and while there could be people that specialize on that, development team feedback on case by case basis should be used to review the actual regulatory interpretation within the organization.

Scrum is not about hindering transparency. On the contrary, transparency is one of core empirical values that guide Scrum. Transparency to interested external stakeholders, such as compliance bodies, should that guide the daily Scrum work and be part of the "Done" definition. An ideal world, state bureaucracy, would be treated as another stakeholder and the product owner, with support for specialized structure within the organization, should try to engage regulatory bureaucracy as early as possible in the product development. In practice, we can make sure, any traceability, verification, and validation requirements are followed during the daily work. Having a cross-functional Scrum team in a regulated environment, means the validation and the regulatory people are part of the development team and contribute daily to achieve the definition of "Done".
