I have been busy lately doing a new certification:

[Management and Strategy Institute - Project Management - Lean Process Certified (PM-LPC)](http://www.msicertified.com/lean-project-management.html)

There were a lot of materials to consume, going sometimes to the very the details, but all in a very condensed form with very few exercises. I had to consult web to find additional information to really grasp some of the covered topics in more depth. My previous IT Project Manager certification covered most of core PM topics and I considered some the material as chance to repeat commonly used PM terminology. The course materials list a lot of contemporary techniques and serve as a good future reference to further extend knowledge on PM and Lean Process. As it is common with similar certifications, it was hard to predict which direction the final exam could take before taking it. I had to go more than once over the material and managed to get a 95% score in the final exam.
