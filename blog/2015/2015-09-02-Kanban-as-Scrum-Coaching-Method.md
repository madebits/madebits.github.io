#Kanban as a Scrum Coaching Method

One of the [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) founding principles is respecting of current team roles and responsibilities. Without demanding any change in the current process, Kanban helps visualize the current work flow as is, in a (digital or physical) board by using time and other project specific task categorization. 

##A Soft Start

Kanban can be used to more that model a Scrum Sprint board or personal activities of team members. It can also be used to coach an existing non-Scrum team towards a Scrum process. Different actors in a existing team having roles that match the waterfall development approach may resist the almost role-less Scrum development team approach. People are often not sure on what role they will fit in a Scrum team. Kanban can be used as a technique to help a team self-organize towards a Scrum team.

Rather than mentioning Scrum explicitly to an existing team, one can ask and coach them to first model their current work as a Kanban board. People will look at what they are currently doing, where it come from, and where it goes. This process can go in several iterations that improve task categorization, having as output a useful Kanban board that model and tracks current work flow for all people involved in an existing project. Once the board is in place and start being used to track progress, the agile coach can start introducing concepts, such limiting work in progress (*LWIP*) to keep the team effective towards delivery in the "Done" part. Kanban is shared with all team members despite their role and contains all their tasks. Kanban helps the team to starts working as whole to understand the big picture of what each individual and the others are doing and why and slowly participate to track and discuss more than their intermediate tasks. If the Kanban board is shared with stakeholders, it helps with transparency and lean adaptation and encourages customer feedback in any phase of the project.

##Fron Kanban to Scrum

For many teams and projects having a Kanban board and learning how to track work and manage LWIP is all that it takes to move to agile planning, and benefit from continuous transparency, inspection, and adaptation. If the Scrum is the end-goal, then once the Kanban is in place and showing its value to the team, Scrum timeboxes can be drawn explicitly on the Kanban board, modeling a Sprint and all activities that take place. Some Scrum-like work is already being done in every project including disusing, conflict management, and task planning. This can be originally traced as unplanned work in the Kanban board and it will look at first irregular. In a second phase (may be in more than one iteration), this 'unplanned' work can be fit to Scrum framework events and practices, such as, backlog review, or Scrum retrospective. A Scrum coach explores the existing Kanban board to find tasks and hints on how to arrange such items in known Scrum events.

##Consolidating Work Structure

Organizing an initial Kanban process to known Scrum events and timeboxes helps the team understand that there is nothing wrong with unplanned items, and that Scrum recognizes that work is more that specification and code development, it also includes direct interaction tasks, retrospective backlog of possible improvements, and intermediate Sprint goals. As people are slowly fitted in the Scrum framework (and allowed to learn by failure), they start contributing to the project where they best fit, making existing waterfall inspired roles diminish in value and lose meaning. Development team starts to work as a whole on all tasks despite their formal roles. The coach is identified as Scrum master. The team will be in constant interruption by stakeholders, so with the help of the Scrum Master the role of the Product Owner is identified as early as possible - as the person that increases the team values while being responsible for the business value of the work.
