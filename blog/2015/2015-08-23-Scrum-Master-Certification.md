#Scrum Master Certification

2015-08-23

<!--- tags: management agile -->

I passed Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) Certification, and I [am](https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Certification-Lists?AssessmentName=PSM%20I&l=Cepa) now a certified Scrum Master.

I passed the PSM I assessment with with a score of 93.8%. I am usually used to pass my assessments near 100%, so a score of 93.8% shows the PSM I assessment is not an easy one. Difficulty comes mainly because:

* It is not fully clear what the questions of the assessment are before starting it. Learning Scrum Guide to the very detail helps to be sure about most of the questions, but not all questions come from there. Some extended Scrum experience is needed.

* While I did not attend a paid Scrum course, one has to have some *correct* Scrum experience. I have seen Scrum implemented on various places, in different forms, so real experience per se is not a warranty to pass PSM I. You need to read and learn best practices in the field from scrum master experts and be able to correctly interpret real life scrum scenarios in context of [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) software development.

In overall, despite my previous Scrum knowledge, I am happy I applied for the certification. I was motivated to learn the right way of handling Scrum process form a Scrum Master point of view. For own exercising, a summary of [scrum guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/) main terminology follows:

* Roles: Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM), Development Team (DT)
* Sprint (Cycle) Events:
    * Start: Sprint Planning (Meeting) (what will be done: Sprint Goal) : {PO, SM, DT}.
    * Every Day: Daily Scrum (Meeting) : {DT, others optional as needed }
    * Some Day: Product Backlog Review (Meeting) ("Done" Increment) : { DT, PO, SM optional }
    * End: Sprint Review (Meeting, Demo) : {PO, SM, DT, stakeholders as needed }
    * End: Sprint Retrospective (Meeting): (Retrospective backlog review) : {SM, DT}
* Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, (optional) Retrospective backlog
