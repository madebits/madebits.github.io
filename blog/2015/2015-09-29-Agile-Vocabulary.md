#Agile Vocabulary

<!--- tags: management agile -->

Agile techniques, methodologies, and frameworks share [agile manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) core values. They are developed in parallel from people of different backgrounds that have come to value individuals, collaboration, working software, and embracing change. There is a lot of overlap, but there is also a lot to learn from the different methods.

##Lean Startup

[Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) - a method for managing (new) products / new features / business. The [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) concept of *Build* - *Measure* - *Learn* loop can be applied to any level (e.g., architectural spikes in Scrum can be modeled as lean processes) and it is not specific to Lean. What makes Lean different is stressing of having actionable metrics to evaluate possible future alternatives. Business people usually apply *pivot* or *persevere* decisions subjectively based on their feelings or post-mortem metrics. Decisions are often wrong or too late. Lean Startup requires thinking about metrics on options as part of the initial setup and iterating over the process possibilities based on the defined metrics. A [business model canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) can be used as a high level guide on lean operations. The *lean* mindset is an important guideline that can be used to approach all agile processes in any level.

##Kanban

[Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) is a board used to model schedules in one or more [value streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping) ([value chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain)). Kanban can be used to model the whole production process (initially as is) and then learn where to optimize (reduce waste in terms of Lean). In software development, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a> can be used to manage knowledge about team work (to be done, in progress, or done). As the rest of agile methods, Kanban is an incremental approach and can be used either alone as a framework, or within the context of Lean or Scrum.

##XP

[Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) (XP) is a methodology that originates from the software development community. XP is made up of several practices, such as pair programming, continuous integration, unit testing, that support collaboration, embrace change, and advocate short iterative development cycles. XP best practices (such as, [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), or [acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) testing) are applied in some form nowadays on every development team, and have heavy influenced all other agile software development methodologies.  

##Scrum

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> is a framework for developing complex products iteratively over time. Products are build by people and therefore people and their self organization are in the core of Scrum. Product backlog owned by product owner (but co-jointly updated with the team) contains any prioritized work to be done. The team selects sprint backlog items from the top of the product log to fully deliver (as workable) during a fixed time-box sprint. Scrum framework specifies several roles, events and resulting artifacts. Scrum team continuously experiments within the Scrum framework (maybe using a retrospective backlog) to increase its velocity. The [agile manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) guides Scrum teams within the Scrum framework. Other agile techniques described here, such as Kanban, Lean or XP can be used within Scrum projects. It is the team as a whole that is responsible for the products and for the best way to develop it.
