## Interest Rate Calculation

Compound interest rate [formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp):

```
Compound interest = p * [(1 + interest rate)^n âˆ’ 1]
where:
p = principal
n = number of compounding periods
```

Where interest rate usually given as **p.a.** (*per annum*), can be positive or negative. For example, with a start capital of 10000 and a compound interest rate of *5% p.a.*, in 10 years, we get:

```
10000 * ((1+0.05) ^10 - 1) = 6288,94
```

To save time, online calculators for compound interest rate and for inflation can be found here:

- https://www.zinsen-berechnen.de/zinsrechner.php
- https://www.finanzen-rechner.net/inflationsrechner.php

To keep things simple, I will compute for a start capital of 100000 units, for 20 years.

Inflation:

- 2% p.a: *100000* become 67.297, loss is **32703** or 32.70%.
- 4% p.a: *100000* become 45.638, loss is **54362** or 54,36%. 

To keep the 100000 units, for 20 years have same purchase value, we need to generate at least same amount of money as it is lost via investing.

## ETFs

Based on the following table show ETF *MSCI World* win for various years from [https://youtu.be/CrjVO0_iOZ4](https://youtu.be/CrjVO0_iOZ4), we can assume a non-warranted average rate of **8% p.a.**:

 To match loss due to inflation for *100000* units in 20 years, one has to invest (with **8% p.a.**):

- With start capital of *10000* for 20 years, one can hope to win in average **36609**. After taxes (26.375%=9655), we get **26953**.
- With start capital of *15000* for 20 years, one can hope to win in average **54914**. After taxes (26.375%=14337), we get **40430**.
- With start capital of *20000* for 20 years, one can hope to win in average **73219**. After taxes (26.375%=19311), we get **53907**.

There two additional costs here:

 1. ETF costs, we can assume they are 0.
 2. Taxes. Unlike for the negative inflation where you are not expected to get negative taxes (positive tax returns), for the positive investment wins one has to pay additionally positive taxes, so the margin of win is smaller than shown. [Taxes](https://www.justetf.com/de/academy/etf-und-steuern.html) are around *26.375%*.

Negative:

- It is a bet. A good bet, but still a bet.
- Not worth lending money to a bank for the start capital.

Positive:

- Needs few money as start capital.

## Property

The p.a rate of a owned property such as a flat that can be rented to another party can be computed as:

```
property win rate p.a. = 12 * Cold rent per month (Kaltmiete) / total paid price
```

The *property win rate p.a.* depends on the location and property quality, but it usually is between *2%* to *6%*. If less, the property is not worth buying.

- Positive with regard to property is that it can be rented using an [Indexmietvertrag](https://ratgeber.immowelt.de/a/indexmietvertrag-wenn-die-inflation-die-miete-in-die-hoehe-treibt.html). The idea here is to keep win rate p.a same by adjusting cold rent based on [inflation](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/609521/umfrage/monatlicher-mietindex-fuer-deutschland/).

The problem is it is hard to find a property worth renting for 100000. The prices are around 300000. This means that one has to have at least 150000 own capital and finance rest 150000 via a bank. 

Positive:

- Assuming the property is not destroyed and not losing much value over time, the money put on the property will keep more or less it original purchase power corrected for inflation.
- Worth to lend money from a bank to buy the property, as long as it is relative sure they can be paid.
- The property win rate p.a. is constant passive income. It can be used to pay part of credit money to the bank.

Negative:

- Needs a much bigger start capital.
- Needs big credit from bank, with its own interest rate p.a.
- It can be sold only after 10 years here, i.e., that is an 10+ years investment.
- Higher management costs (both money and time), thought some can be reduced from taxes.
