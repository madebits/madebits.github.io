#Encrypted Image Gallery

<!--- tags: javascript -->

Proof of concept (PoC) for delivering encrypted images to a web browser and decrypting them locally using JavaScript. Tested in Chrome browser (48). The demo makes use of several HTML5 JavaScript APIs, such as, [web workers](#blog/2016/2016-03-03-WebWorker-Patterns.md) and binary blobs.
