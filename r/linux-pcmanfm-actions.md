Sample PcManFm custom actions, for Lubuntu 14.04

![](r/linux-pcmanfm-actions/pcmancustom.png)

The following actions are provided:

* Open As Root - opens folders as root in PcManFm and text files as root in leafpad.
* Empty Trash - extends PcManFm trash folder shortcut in Desktop with a context-menu to directly empty trash.
* Custom Actions (menu)
* Edit As Text - uses leafpad by default, edit .desktop file in usr/local/share/file-manager/actions/ after install to use another editor (such as Sublime Text or Geany).
* Set As Wallpaper - sets an image file as Desktop wallpaper.
* Backup File Here - creates a copy of the selected file with a new name *.YYYYMMDD-HHmmSS.bak in the same folder.
* Copy To Folder - copy to selected UI folder.
* Rename Shortcut - renames a .desktop file.
* Create Desktop Shortcut - create a .desktop file on Desktop for the selected file, offering to edit it further.

If you have installed a previous version, uninstall it and install the latest. You need to logout and login again after the package install for the custom actions to appear. Some more details can be found in my original blog [post](#blog/2014/2014-03-17-Custom-PcManFM-Context-Menu-Actions.md).
